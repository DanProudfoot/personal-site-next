## What is it?

Sustainably is a charity giving app for Android and iOS. We allow users to make monthly payments or round-up their spending and contribute to charities.

## What did I contribute?

When I joined Sustainably in 2020 there was a basic React-web app shipped inside an Expo wrapper that wasn't fit for purpose. Over the course of the last year I oversaw many upgrades to our platform including:

- Upgrading to Capacitor to allow communication with a rich ecosystem of native APIs
- Implementing Branch deep links to allow external links and install attribution
- Migrate away fully from redux to a much simpler react-query based system
- Create a shared component library that we could use across all of our web apps
- Migrating to styled-components and removing a complicated mix of css modules and sass
- Creating a powerful deployment system using Github actions and App Center CodePush to generate builds for testing and release.
